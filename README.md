## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+ recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

---

### 2. Setup Instructions

#### Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/GameStack-Frontend.git
    cd GameStack-Frontend

#### Install dependencies
    npm install

or

    yarn install

---

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

#### Ensure your environment variables are properly set in the backend:

    REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
    
    # IGDB API
    REACT_APP_IGDB_CLIENT_ID=your_twitch_client_id
    REACT_APP_IGDB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_twitch_client_secret

#### âš¡ **Important**:

To access the IGDB API, you must create a Twitch Developer Application to get your CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET:

- [Register a Twitch application here](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication/register-app/)
- Set "OAuth Redirect URL" to http://localhost
- Get your Client ID and generate a Client Secret
- These credentials will be used to fetch an OAuth token automatically in the app.

---

### 4. Running the Application

#### Start the development server:

    npm start

or

    yarn start

The app will run at:

    http://localhost:3000/

---

### ðŸŽ® IGDB API Integration Details

- IGDB is used to search for real-world games based on title.
- When adding a new game, users can search by name and select a game from IGDB's live results.
- Pulled metadata includes:

    - Cover image
    - Title
    - Release date
    - Platforms
    - Genre
    - Summary/description
    - IGDB game rating

- Selected games are saved into the user's backlog with custom status and rating.

The app handles:

- Token Authentication (fetches an access token using the Twitch credentials)
- Rate limiting management to avoid unnecessary token refreshes
- Secure usage of the IGDB API with client credentials kept in environment variables

---

### ðŸ”¥ Important Notes
- Ensure the backend is running first to interact with APIs.
- JWT tokens are stored in localStorage for session management.
- Only users with the ADMIN role will be able to access admin routes.
- The project uses Material UI's ThemeProvider for dynamic light/dark mode.
- _This application uses the [IGDB API](https://www.igdb.com/) but is not endorsed or certified by IGDB or Twitch_.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
